# AMR-in-gonorrhoea

## Decsription
Gonorrhoea  is one of the commonly sexually transmitted bacterial illnesses all over world. Over a period of time, the bacteria gonococcus has grown resistant to all medications previously used to treat it, from penicillin to cefixime, the possibility of Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR) in gonorrhoea is a huge concern. Earlier, the patients were treated with first-line medication (using single drug), which led to a limited number of antibiotics having any impact. Ceftriaxone and azithromycin were suggested as dual treatments . Here, we are aiming to find patterns in Resistance towards antibiotics by applying machine learning techniques to determine whether the pathogen will be resistant to antibiotics ciprofloxacin and azithromycin.
